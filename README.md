# Huffman Tree Text Encryption Method

This is an assignment from our CS lab, which primarily implements encryption and decryption using a Huffman tree. In the future, we plan to attempt developing a dual-key encryption method.

Currently, the encryption method is limited to the 26 uppercase English letters.
